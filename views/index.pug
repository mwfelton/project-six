        each project in projects
          .cell
            a(href=`/projects/${project.id}`)
              img.thumbnail(src=`project.image_urls.main`, alt=`project.image_urls.mainalt`)
              h5= project.project_name


      //- Use the Pug `each` iterator to loop over the projects in your data file  
      
        //- Use the example Pug code below and interpolated template literals as needed to dynamically generate:

          //- The paths in the link's href and img's src attributes
          
          //- The text 'Thumbnail' interpolated with the project title for the img's alt attribute
          //- The project title for the h5 element's text
